# HelloBooks
A library app that allows users to register to create account, then log in using their account, view the available books, borrow books, view their profile i.e. books they've borrowed and finally users can return books borrowed.
The app also allows the Admin to view all the books borrowed by a particular user, add a book, delete a book and edit a book information.
